Code Challenge [You have 30 minutes to complete this challenge]:
  As a Senior Web SDK Developer, you will need to demonstrate your skills in creating a simple Web SDK that interacts with a mock API. Your task is to build a small JavaScript library that can fetch data from a public API and expose it in a way that is easy for developers to use.
Task:
  Create a JavaScript module that fetches data from the JSONPlaceholder API (a free fake online REST API for testing and prototyping).
  The module should have a method getPosts that retrieves a list of posts and returns it as a promise.
  Implement error handling to manage any potential issues during the fetch operation.
  Write a simple test case using Jest to verify that the getPosts method works correctly.
Requirements:
  Use JavaScript (ES6+)
  Use Fetch API for making HTTP requests
  Implement error handling
  Use Jest for testing
Technologies
  JavaScript (ES6+)
  Jest (for testing)
